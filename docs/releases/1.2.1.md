# 1.2.1

📅 Released: 2026-01-26

## ✨ New Features

- **Memo Replies** - Added support for a second level of memos. You can now reply to any top-level memo to group related thoughts, similar to Twitter threads.
  - New "Reply" button in memo tooltips
  - Hierarchical display with indentation and reply indicators
  - Nested deletion: deleting a parent memo can optionally delete all its replies
- **Markdown Indentation Setting** - Renamed "Task indentation" to "Markdown indentation" as it now applies to both tasks and memo replies.

## 🔧 Improvements

- Enhanced memo parser to correctly handle nested lists and mixed indentation styles.
- Standardized internal indentation logic across the plugin.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where `taskIndentStyle` was only applied to tasks.

## 📝 Notes

- Memo replies use the same indentation style configured in settings (Tab, 2-spaces, or 4-spaces).
- Currently, hierarchy is limited to 2 levels (parent and reply) for optimal UI experience.
