# 1.1.3

📅 Released: 2026-01-26

## ✨ New Features

- **Task indentation style setting** - Added a new setting to configure the indentation character for tasks. Users can now choose between:
  - Tab (default)
  - 2 spaces
  - 4 spaces

## 🔧 Improvements

_None_

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Schedule strikethrough not updating after accepting event** - Fixed an issue where strikethrough styling remained on schedule events after changing participation status from declined to accepted in calendar. The parser now correctly uses only the calendar owner's participation status instead of checking all attendees.

## 📝 Notes

- This setting affects how new indentation is applied when moving tasks or copying tasks from previous days
- The parser now correctly handles mixed indentation styles (tabs and spaces) in existing files
